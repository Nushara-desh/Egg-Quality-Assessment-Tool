# Egg-Quality-Assessment-Tool

Rising global demand for eggs, driven by population growth and their role as an affordable, nutrient-rich protein source, underscores the need for reliable quality inspection. Manual inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and unsuitable for high-throughput industrial settings, highlighting the need for automated solutions. This study proposes a lightweight ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for real-time, non-destructive cracked egg detection, integrating multi-scale convolutional kernels to enhance feature diversity and reduce overfitting. The model achieved 97.43% classification accuracy, outperforming GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19, while maintaining high computational efficiency with 25.5 ms per image, 17.9% CPU usage, and 2.10 GB memory consumption. Compared to manual grading (~3.6 seconds per egg), the system offers nearly a 100-fold increase in throughput. Overall, the proposed approach balances accuracy, speed, and efficiency, making it well-suited for industrial egg-sorting and packaging applications.
